Find the HaloID corresponding to the cluster with an r200crit > 1.0 and an m200crit < $2\\times10^{4}$. Note that HaloID should have data as integers, meaning you will want to break off that component of the data into a separate array with int data type, and keep the other two (which are floats) in a single ndarray with float data type\n",
